# A Restauraunt Recipe/Menu UI with JupyterLite

This project aims to creates user interfaces for viewing and interacting with recipe/menu data using JupyterLite and ipywidgets. The code reads from a user supplied excel file containing a recipe sheet and a price list sheet (format yet to be specified). Currently there is one user interface for viewing ingredients and allergens ('amc_menu_view.py') and second that is used for editing recipes, menus and prices ('amc_menucost_code.py').

## Project Description

This project uses JupyterLite to create a user-friendly interface for exploring the recipe/menu ingredients. The interface allows users to search and view recipe ingredients and major allergens.

- 'amc_menucost_code.py': User interface to edit and view recipe/menu data.
